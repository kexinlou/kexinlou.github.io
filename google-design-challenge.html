    <p><b>Overview</b>: This is a case study I did as a part of Google’s recruiting process. The prompt was to design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other and help new students adjust to campus life.</p>
    <p><strong>Role</strong>: Individual Project (UX Design, UX Research, Visual Design) </p>
    <p><strong>Tool Kits</strong>: Figma, InVision</p>
    <p><strong> Timeline</strong>: ~1 week </p>

<h2>00. Project Summary</h2>
<div class="summary">
  <img src="assets/google-design-challenge/find-mentor.gif" alt="Mentorship Matching" class="project_img">
  <div class="summary_txt">
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>New students want to connect and establish long-term personal relationship with experienced students to better navigate college life. A lot of new students struggle about matching up with <span class="accent-google">random mentors</span> and <span class="accent-google">end up not keeping in touch</span> with mentors.</p>
    <h3>How might we create an experience to connect best-fit students and enhance long-term mentorship?</h3>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>A mentorship program with mobile app that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>matches mentee with mentors based on mutual interests and personal preference</li>
      <li>provides event exploration to encourage hangouts and recommend bonding events</li>
      <li>suggests personal invitations to resolve time conflicts and build long-term relationship</li>
    </ul>

<h2>01. Research</h2>
<p><strong>Understanding the problem</strong> </p>
<p>In order to understand new students’ needs for a mentor and experienced students’ thoughts, I sent out a preliminary survey asking students at Cornell about their journey to find a mentor /mentee.  I collected 35 responses and conducted ~5 in person interviews to learn users’ needs and design goals.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Competitive research</strong> </p>
<p>i. How current new students get connected with a mentor? </p>
<p>At the beginning of the school year, I always received tons of emails from school organizations asking students to sign up for mentorships. School orgs and clubs reach out to students with the same major and send out a <span class="accent-google"> Google form</span> asking for personal preference. Then you will be assigned a mentor / mentee. However, it’s a <span class="accent-google">blind date</span> and not everyone can get the mentor that best fits them.</p>
<img src="assets/google-design-challenge/google-form.png" alt="Google Form" class="small_img">
<p>ii. How mentors and mentees stay connected?</p>
<p>At school, many clubs and orgs publish their events and invite students on <span class="accent-google">Facebook Event</span> page. However, Facebook Event thread is <span class="accent-google">overwhelming</span> for new students to discover events that are tailored towards mentorship bonding.</p>

<h2>02. Ideation</h2>
<p>After I identified users’ needs and problems with current solution, I brainstormed several features to address user concerns one by one.</p>

<h2>03. Design</h2>
<p><strong>Low-fi wireframes</strong></p>
<p>I decided to sketch some low fidelity wireframes and test my initial ideas with friends. </p>

<p><strong>Design iterations</strong></p>
<p><strong>i. Matching process: two way selection or algorithm-based matching?</strong></p>
<p>I decided to go with version 2 as the matching process is more efficient and better satisfies users’ needs.</p>

<img src="assets/google-design-challenge/version2.png" alt="Version 2" class="large_img">
<p><strong>ii. How to better stay connected</strong></p>
<p>I decided to go with version 2 as mentoring experience will be more engaging. The homepage not only has a free space to express but also displays cute badges to enhance relationships.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>05. Reflection</h2>
<p>Due to time constraint, I designed the most important features to stay connected. In the future, I would like to add more social aspects to the app such as building a family system. A family system will let new students meet their mentors’ mentors and connect them with more experienced students and give them a sense of belonging. Mentees are also more willing to contribute back to the community when they become experienced students at school in the future.</p>
